1. Introduction
Recently a series of Large Language Models (LLMs) have been introduced (Brown et al., 2020; Lieber
et al., 2021; Rae et al., 2021; Smith et al., 2022; Thoppilan et al., 2022), with the largest dense
language models now having over 500 billion parameters. These large autoregressive transformers
(Vaswani et al., 2017) have demonstrated impressive performance on many tasks using a variety of
evaluation protocols such as zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning.
The compute and energy cost for training large language models is substantial (Rae et al., 2021;
Thoppilan et al., 2022) and rises with increasing model size. In practice, the allocated training
compute budget is often known in advance: how many accelerators are available and for how long
we want to use them. Since it is typically only feasible to train these large models once, accurately
estimating the best model hyperparameters for a given compute budget is critical (Tay et al., 2021).
Kaplan et al. (2020) showed that there is a power law relationship between the number of
parameters in an autoregressive language model (LM) and its performance. As a result, the field has
beentraininglargerandlargermodels,expectingperformanceimprovements. Onenotableconclusion
in Kaplan et al. (2020) is that large models should not be trained to their lowest possible loss to be
compute optimal. Whilst we reach the same conclusion, we estimate that large models should be
trained for many more training tokens than recommended by the authors. Specifically, given a 10×
increase computational budget, they suggests that the size of the model should increase 5.5× while
the number of training tokens should only increase 1.8×. Instead, we find that model size and the
number of training tokens should be scaled in equal proportions.
Following Kaplan et al. (2020) and the training setup of GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), many of the
recently trained large models have been trained for approximately 300 billion tokens (Table 1), in
line with the approach of predominantly increasing model size when increasing compute.

In this work, we revisit the question: Given a fixed FLOPs budget, 1 how should one trade-off model
size and the number of training tokens? To answer this question, we model the final pre-training loss2
𝐿(𝑁,𝐷) as a function of the number of model parameters 𝑁, and the number of training tokens, 𝐷.
Since the computational budget 𝐶 is a deterministic function FLOPs(𝑁,𝐷) of the number of seen
training tokens and model parameters, we are interested in minimizing 𝐿 under the constraint
FLOPs(𝑁,𝐷) =𝐶:
𝑁 (𝐶),𝐷 (𝐶) = argmin 𝐿(𝑁,𝐷). (1)

than that of Kaplan et al. (2020). We highlight our results in Figure 1 and how our approaches differ
in Section 2.
Based on our estimated compute-optimal frontier, we predict that for the compute budget used
to train Gopher, an optimal model should be 4 times smaller, while being training on 4 times more
tokens. Weverifythisbytrainingamorecompute-optimal70Bmodel,calledChinchilla,on1.4trillion
tokens. Not only does Chinchilla outperform its much larger counterpart, Gopher, but its reduced
model size reduces inference cost considerably and greatly facilitates downstream uses on smaller
hardware. The energy cost of a large language model is amortized through its usage for inference an
fine-tuning. The benefits of a more optimally trained smaller model, therefore, extend beyond the
immediate benefits of its improved performance.

et al., 2021; Smith et al., 2022; Thoppilan et al., 2022) and mixture-of-expert (MoE) models (Du
et al., 2021; Fedus et al., 2021; Zoph et al., 2022). The largest dense transformers have passed 500
billion parameters (Smith et al., 2022). The drive to train larger and larger models is clear—so far

language modelling tasks. Nonetheless, large language models face several challenges, including
their overwhelming computational requirements (the cost of training and inference increase with
model size) (Rae et al., 2021; Thoppilan et al., 2022) and the need for acquiring more high-quality
trainingdata. Infact,inthisworkwefindthatlarger,highqualitydatasetswillplayakeyroleinany

| ------- | ------- | ----------- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Modelling the scaling behavior. Understanding the scaling behaviour of language models and
their transfer properties has been important in the development of recent large models (Hernandez
etal.,2021;Kaplanetal.,2020). Kaplanetal.(2020)firstshowedapredictablerelationshipbetween
model size and loss over many orders of magnitude. The authors investigate the question of choosing
the optimal model size to train for a given compute budget. Similar to us, they address this question
by training various models. Our work differs from Kaplan et al. (2020) in several important ways.
First,theauthorsuseafixednumberoftrainingtokensandlearningratescheduleforallmodels;this
prevents them from modelling the impact of these hyperparameters on the loss. In contrast, we find
that setting the learning rate schedule to approximately match the number of training tokens results
inthebestfinallossregardlessofmodelsize—seeFigureA1. Forafixedlearningratecosineschedule
to 130B tokens, the intermediate loss estimates (for 𝐷(cid:48) << 130B) are therefore overestimates of the
lossofamodeltrainedwithaschedulelengthmatching 𝐷(cid:48). Usingtheseintermediatelossesresultsin

budget increases. In contrast, our analysis predicts that both quantities should scale at roughly the
same rate. Secondly, we include models with up to 16B parameters, as we observe that there is slight
curvature in the FLOP-loss frontier (see Appendix E)—in fact, the majority of the models used in
our analysis have more than 500 million parameters, in contrast the majority of runs in Kaplan et al.
(2020) are significantly smaller—many being less than 100M parameters.
Recently, Clark et al. (2022) specifically looked in to the scaling properties of Mixture of Expert
3

language models, showing that the scaling with number of experts diminishes as the model size
increases—their approach models the loss as a function of two variables: the model size and the
numberofexperts. However,theanalysisisdonewithafixednumberoftrainingtokens,asinKaplan
et al. (2020), potentially underestimating the improvements of branching.
Estimatinghyperparametersforlargemodels. Themodelsizeandthenumberoftrainingtokens
are not the only two parameters to chose when selecting a language model and a procedure to train
it. Other important factors include learning rate, learning rate schedule, batch size, optimiser, and
width-to-depth ratio. In this work, we focus on model size and the number of training steps, and
we rely on existing work and provided experimental heuristics to determine the other necessary
hyperparameters. Yang et al. (2021) investigates how to choose a variety of these parameters for
training an autoregressive transformer, including the learning rate and batch size. McCandlish et al.
(2018) finds only a weak dependence between optimal batch size and model size. Shallue et al.
(2018);Zhangetal.(2019)suggestthatusinglargerbatch-sizesthanthoseweuseispossible. Levine
et al. (2020) investigates the optimal depth-to-width ratio for a variety of standard model sizes. We

Improved model architectures. Recently,variouspromisingalternativestotraditionaldensetrans-
formers have been proposed. For example, through the use of conditional computation large MoE
models like the 1.7 trillion parameter Switch transformer (Fedus et al., 2021), the 1.2 Trillion pa-
rameter GLaM model (Du et al., 2021), and others (Artetxe et al., 2021; Zoph et al., 2022) are able
to provide a large effective model size despite using relatively fewer training and inference FLOPs.
However,forverylargemodelsthecomputationalbenefitsofroutedmodelsseemstodiminish(Clark
et al., 2022). An orthogonal approach to improving language models is to augment transformers
with explicit retrieval mechanisms, as done by Borgeaud et al. (2021); Guu et al. (2020); Lewis et al.
(2020). This approach effectively increases the number of data tokens seen during training (by a
factor of ∼ 10 in Borgeaud et al. (2021)). This suggests that the performance of language models
may be more dependant on the size of the training data than previously thought.
3. Estimating the optimal parameter/training tokens allocation
We present three different approaches to answer the question driving our research: Given a fixed
FLOPs budget, how should one trade-off model size and the number of training tokens? In all three
cases we start by training a range of models varying both model size and the number of training
tokens and use the resulting training curves to fit an empirical estimator of how they should scale.
We assume a power-law relationship between compute and model size as done in Clark et al. (2022);
Kaplanetal.(2020),thoughfutureworkmaywanttoincludepotentialcurvatureinthisrelationship
for large model sizes. The resulting predictions are similar for all three methods and suggest that
parameter count and number of training tokens should be increased equally with more compute3—
with proportions reported in Table 2. This is in clear contrast to previous work on this topic and
warrants further investigation.

3.1. Approach 1: Fix model sizes and vary number of training tokens
In our first approach we vary the number of training steps for a fixed family of models (ranging from
70M to over 10B parameters), training each model for 4 different number of training sequences.
From these runs, we are able to directly extract an estimate of the minimum loss achieved for a given
number of training FLOPs. Training details for this approach can be found in Appendix D.
For each parameter count 𝑁 we train 4 different models, decaying the learning rate by a factor of
10×overahorizon(measuredinnumberoftrainingtokens)thatrangesbyafactorof16×. Then,for
each run, we smooth and then interpolate the training loss curve. From this, we obtain a continuous
mapping from FLOP count to training loss for each run. Then, for each FLOP count, we determine
which run achieves the lowest loss. Using these interpolants, we obtain a mapping from any FLOP
count 𝐶, to the most efficient choice of model size 𝑁 and number of training tokens 𝐷 such that

The first term captures the loss for an ideal generative process on the data distribution, and should

We account for possible local minima by selecting the best fitfrom a grid ofinitialisations. The Huber

We find that the three approaches, despite using different fitting methodologies and different trained
models, yield comparable predictions for the optimal scaling in parameters and tokens with FLOPs
(shown in Table 2). All three approaches suggest that as compute budget increases, model size and
the amount of training data should be increased in approximately equal proportions. The first and
second approaches yield very similar predictions for optimal model sizes, as shown in Figure 1 and
FigureA3. Thethirdapproachpredictsevensmallermodelsbeingoptimalatlargercomputebudgets.

points as outliers due to the Huber loss. As a consequence of the empirically observed negative

large language models are considerably over-sized, given their respective compute budgets, as shown
inFigure1. Forexample,wefindthata175billionparametermodelshouldbetrainedwithacompute

6.8 trillion tokens. Unless one has a compute budget of 1026 FLOPs (over 250× the compute used to
train Gopher), a 1 trillion parameter model is unlikely to be the optimal model to train. Furthermore,
the amount of training data that is projected to be needed is far beyond what is currently used to
train large models, and underscores the importance of dataset collection in addition to engineering
improvements that allow for model scale. While there is significant uncertainty extrapolating out
many orders of magnitude, our analysis clearly suggests that given the training compute budget for
many current LLMs, smaller models should have been trained on more tokens to achieve the most

In Appendix C, we reproduce the IsoFLOP analysis on two additional datasets: C4 (Raffel et al.,
2020a) and GitHub code (Rae et al., 2021). In both cases we reach the similar conclusion that model
size and number of training tokens should be scaled in equal proportions.

BasedonouranalysisinSection3,theoptimalmodelsizefortheGophercomputebudgetissomewhere
between 40 and 70 billion parameters. We test this hypothesis by training a model on the larger end
of this range—70B parameters—for 1.4T tokens, due to both dataset and computational efficiency
considerations. In this section we compare this model, which we call Chinchilla, to and other
Gopher
LLMs. Both Chinchilla and Gopher have been trained for the same number of FLOPs but differ in the
| size | of the | model | and | the number | of  | training tokens. |     |     |     |     |     |

While pre-training a large language model has a considerable compute cost, downstream fine-
tuning and inference also make up substantial compute usage (Rae et al., 2021). Due to being 4×
smaller than Gopher, both the memory footprint and inference cost of are also smaller.

We perform an extensive evaluation of Chinchilla, comparing against various large language models.
We evaluate on a large subset of the tasks presented in Rae et al. (2021), shown in Table 5. As
the focus of this work is on optimal model scaling, we included a large representative subset, and
introduce a few new evaluations to allow for better comparison to other existing large models. The
evaluation details for all tasks are the same as described in Rae et al. (2021).

albeit with slightly different relative weights, and because it has a similar architecture. Here, we
examine gender bias (particularly gender and occupation bias) and generation of toxic language. We
select a few common evaluations to highlight potential issues, but stress that our evaluations are not
comprehensive and much work remains to understand, evaluate, and mitigate risks in LLMs.
Gender bias. As discussed in Rae et al. (2021), large language models reflect contemporary and
historical discourse about different groups (such as gender groups) from their training dataset, and
we expect the same to be true for Chinchilla. Here, we test if potential gender and occupation biases
manifest in unfair outcomes on coreference resolutions, using the Winogender dataset (Rudinger
et al., 2018) in a zero-shot setting. Winogender tests whether a model can correctly determine if
a pronoun refers to different occupation words. An unbiased model would correctly predict which
word the pronoun refers to regardless of pronoun gender. We follow the same setup as in Rae et al.

As shown in Table 10, Chinchilla correctly resolves pronouns more frequently than Gopher across
allgroups. Interestingly,theperformanceincreaseisconsiderablysmallerformalepronouns(increase
of 3.2%) than for female or neutral pronouns (increases of 8.3% and 9.2% respectively). We also

(determined by labor statistics). Again, we see that Chinchilla resolves pronouns more accurately
than Gopher. When breaking up examples by male/female gender and gotcha/not gotcha, the largest

whetherthesameholdstrueforalowerLMlossachievedviamorecompute-optimaltraining. Similar
to the protocol of Rae et al. (2021), we generate 25,000 unprompted samples from Chinchilla, and
compare their PerspectiveAPI toxicity score distribution to that of Gopher-generated samples. Several
summary statistics indicate an absence of major differences: the mean (median) toxicity score for
Gopher is 0.081 (0.064), compared to 0.087 (0.066) for Chinchilla, and the 95th percentile scores
are 0.230 for Gopher, compared to 0.238 for Chinchilla. That is, the large majority of generated
samples are classified as non-toxic, and the difference between the models is negligible. In line with
prior findings (Rae et al., 2021), this suggests that toxicity levels in unconditional text generation
are largely independent of the model quality (measured in language modelling loss), i.e. that better
models of the training dataset are not necessarily more toxic.
5. Discussion & Conclusion
The trend so far in large language model training has been to increase the model size, often without
increasing the number of training tokens. The largest dense transformer, MT-NLG 530B, is now
over 3× larger than GPT-3’s 170 billion parameters from just two years ago. However, this model,
as well as the majority of existing large models, have all been trained for a comparable number
of tokens—around 300 billion. While the desire to train these mega-models has led to substantial
engineering innovation, we hypothesize that the race to train larger and larger models is resulting in
models that are substantially underperforming compared to what could be achieved with the same
compute budget.
We propose three predictive approaches towards optimally setting model size and training dura-
tion, based on the outcome of over 400 training runs. All three approaches predict that Gopher is
substantially over-sized and estimate that for the same compute budget a smaller model trained on
moredatawillperformbetter. WedirectlytestthishypothesisbytrainingChinchilla,a70Bparameter
model, and show that it outperforms Gopher and even larger models on nearly every measured
evaluation task.
Whilst our method allows us to make predictions on how to scale large models when given
additional compute, there are several limitations. Due to the cost of training large models, we only
have two comparable training runs at large scale (Chinchilla and Gopher), and we do not have
additional tests at intermediate scales. Furthermore, we assume that the efficient computational
frontier can be described by a power-law relationship between the compute budget, model size, and
numberoftrainingtokens. However,weobservesomeconcavityinlog(cid:0)𝑁 (cid:1) athighcomputebudgets
𝑜𝑝𝑡
(see Appendix E). This suggests that we may still be overestimating the optimal size of large models.
Finally, the training runs for our analysis have all been trained on less than an epoch of data; future
workmayconsiderthemultipleepochregime. Despitetheselimitations,thecomparisonofChinchilla
to Gopher validates our performance predictions, that have thus enabled training a better (and more
15

lightweight) model at the same compute budget.
Though there has been significant recent work allowing larger and larger models to be trained,
our analysis suggests an increased focus on dataset scaling is needed. Speculatively, we expect that
scaling to larger and larger datasets is only beneficial when the data is high-quality. This calls for
responsiblycollectinglargerdatasetswithahighfocusondatasetquality. Largerdatasetswillrequire
extra care to ensure train-test set overlap is properly accounted for, both in the language modelling
loss but also with downstream tasks. Finally, training for trillions of tokens introduces many ethical
and privacy concerns. Large datasets scraped from the web will contain toxic language, biases, and
private information. With even larger datasets being used, the quantity (if not the frequency) of such
information increases, which makes dataset introspection all the more important. Chinchilla does
sufferfrombiasandtoxicitybutinterestinglyitseemslessaffectedthanGopher. Betterunderstanding
how performance of large language models and toxicity interact is an important future research
question.
While we have applied our methodology towards the training of auto-regressive language models,
we expect that there is a similar trade-off between model size and the amount of data in other
modalities. As training large models is very expensive, choosing the optimal model size and training
steps beforehand is essential. The methods we propose are easy to reproduce in new settings.

Figure A1 | Grid over cosine cycle length. We show 6 curves with the cosine cycle length set to 1,
1.1,1.25,1.5,2,and5×longerthanthetargetnumberoftrainingsteps. Whenthecosinecyclelength
is too long, and the learning rate does not drop appropriately, then performance is impaired. We find
that overestimating the number of training steps beyond 25% leads to clear drops in performance.
We show results where we have set the number of training steps to two different values (top and
bottom).

We use 𝛿 = 10−3 for the Huber loss. We find that using larger values of 𝛿 pushes the model to
overfit the small compute regime and poorly predict held-out data from larger runs. We find that
using a 𝛿 smaller than 10−3 does not impact the resulting predictions.

For 1021 FLOPs, we perform a head-to-head comparison of a model predicted by Approach 1 and
that predicted by Kaplan et al. (2020). For both models, we use a batch size of 0.5M tokens and a
26

maximum learning rate of 1.5×10−4 that decays by 10×. From Kaplan et al. (2020), we find that
the optimal model size should be 4.68 billion parameters. From our approach 1, we estimate a 2.86
billion parameter model should be optimal. We train a 4.74 billion parameter and a 2.80 billion
parameter transformer to test this hypothesis, using the same depth-to-width ratio to avoid as many
confounding factors as possible. We find that our predicted model outperforms the model predicted
| by Kaplan | et al. (2020) | as shown | in Figure | A4. |     |     |

We follow the same setup as in Rae et al. (2021). To test coreference resolution in Chinchilla, we
input a sentence which includes a pronoun reference (e.g., “The librarian helped the child pick out a
book because {pronoun} liked to encourage reading.”), then measure the probability of the model
completing the sentence “‘{Pronoun}’ refers to the” with different sentence roles (“librarian” and
“child”inthisexample). Eachexampleisannotatedwiththecorrectpronounresolution(thepronoun
corresponds to the librarian in this example). Each sentence is tested with a female, male, and
gender-neutral pronoun. An unbiased model would correctly predict which word the pronoun refers
| to regardless | of pronoun | gender. |     |     |     |

Datasets
• Language modelling on LAMBADA, Wikitext103 (Mer-
ity et al., 2017), C4 (Raffel et al., 2020a), PG-19 (Rae
et al., 2020) and the Pile (Gao et al., 2020).
• Language understanding, real world knowledge,
mathematical and logical reasoning on the Massive
Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) bench-
mark (Hendrycks et al., 2020) and on the “Beyond the
Imitation Game Benchmark” (BIG-bench) (BIG-bench
collaboration, 2021).
• Question answering (closed book) on Natural Ques-
tions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) and TriviaQA (Joshi
et al., 2017).
• Reading comprehension on RACE (Lai et al., 2017)
• Common sense understanding on HellaSwag (Zellers
et al., 2019), PIQA (Bisk et al., 2020), Wino-
grande(Sakaguchietal.,2020),SIQA(Sapetal.,2019),
BoolQ (Clark et al., 2019), and TruthfulQA (Lin et al.,
2021).
Motivation We chose evaluations from Rae et al. (2021) to allow us to
most directly compare to Gopher.
Preprocessing Input text is tokenized using a SentencePiece tokenizer with
a vocabulary of size 32,000. Unlike the tokenizer used for
Gopher, the tokenizer used for Chinchilla does not perform
NFKC normalization.
Training Data
The same dataset is used as in Rae et al. (2021). Differences in sampling are shown in Table A1.
Quantitative Analyses
Unitary Results Section 4.2 gives a detailed description of our analysis. Main
take-aways include:
• Our model is capable of outputting toxic language as
measured by the PerspectiveAPI. This is particularly
true when the model is prompted with toxic prompts.
• Gender: Our model emulates stereotypes found in our
dataset, with occupations such as “dietician” and “re-
ceptionist”beingmoreassociatedwithwomenand“car-
penter” and “sheriff” being more associated with men.
• Race/religion/country sentiment: Prompting our
model to discuss some groups leads to sentences with
lower or higher sentiment, likely reflecting text in our
dataset.

Mitigations We considered filtering the dataset to remove toxic content

Use Cases Especially fraught use cases include the generation of fac-
|     | tually incorrect |      | information |        |           | with the     | intent | of           | distributing |

|     | toxic text       | with | harmful     |        | intent.   | Many         | more   | use          | cases that   |
|     | could cause      |      | harm        | exist. | Such      | applications |        | to malicious | use          |
|     | are discussed    |      | in detail   | in     | Weidinger |              | et al. | (2021).      |              |
